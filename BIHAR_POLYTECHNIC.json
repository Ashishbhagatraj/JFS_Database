    "description": "The Bihar DCECE Polytechnic PE 1st Round Final Seat Allotment Result 2025 has been officially released by the Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board (BCECEB) on July 13, 2025, for candidates who appeared in the DCECE 2025 exam and participated in the Bihar Polytechnic counselling process. The DCECE PE 1st round seat allotment 2025 is available on the official website bceceboard.bihar.gov.in, and students can now download the seat allotment letter online. The Polytechnic Engineering counselling result 2025 is based on the candidate's DCECE 2025 rank, choice filling, reservation category, and availability of seats in government and private polytechnic colleges across Bihar. Candidates who have been allotted a seat in the first round must report to their respective institutes between July 14 to July 17, 2025, for document verification and admission confirmation. At the time of reporting, candidates need to carry their DCECE PE seat allotment letter, original documents, photocopies, and passport-size photographs to complete the verification and admission process. Failure to report on time may lead to cancellation of the allotted seat. The Bihar Polytechnic seat allotment result 2025 is an important milestone for students seeking diploma admission in Bihar for the academic session 2025–26. For those not satisfied with their current allotment or those who did not get a seat in the first round, the Bihar DCECE 2nd round counselling 2025 will be conducted soon, and the official schedule will be updated on the BCECEB website. Students are advised to regularly check for updates on DCECE counselling date 2025, Bihar Polytechnic vacancy list 2025, and DCECE 2025 second round seat allotment.",
